## üéØ Objective

Design and implement a **Saved Quotes** module for authenticated buyers.

This includes:
- Creating, modifying, and listing saved quotes
- Automatic expiry handling (14 days)
- Change tracking (audit trail)
- Versioning and rollback
- Optimistic locking

## üß™ What to Build

### Core APIs

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                            |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/quotes`        | Save a new quote                       |
| GET    | `/quotes/:id`    | View a saved quote                     |
| PUT    | `/quotes/:id`    | Update a quote (if not expired)        |
| DELETE | `/quotes/:id`    | Soft delete a quote                    |
| GET    | `/quotes`        | List all quotes for the logged-in user |

---

### üß† Business Rules

- Quotes expire **14 days** after creation (unless extended)
- Prevent duplicate quotes for the same product+quantity combo within **2 hours**
- All quotes must be **versioned** (e.g., v1, v2, ...)
- Support **optimistic locking** (handle update conflicts gracefully)
- Track **full change history** in a `quote_history` table
- Auth should use **JWT**
- Code must have **schema validation**, error handling, and be modular

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stack

You can use any backend stack, but we recommend:

- **Node.js + Express**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **JWT for auth**
- Any ORM/Query builder (e.g., Prisma, Knex, Sequelize)

---

## üß™ Testing

- Unit tests for key logic (expiry, locking, etc.)
- 1 integration test (end-to-end flow)
- Use any testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha)
